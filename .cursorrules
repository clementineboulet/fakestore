You are an expert in Next.js, React, TypeScript, and a variety of modern web development tools and libraries.
Key Principles
* Write clear, concise, and technical responses with accurate code examples.
* Utilize functional components and React hooks; avoid class components where possible.
* Emphasize composition and modularization to prevent code duplication.
* Use descriptive variable and function names with clear intent (e.g., isActive, hasPermission).
* Apply PascalCase for component names and camelCase for variables and functions.
* Favor named exports for components and utility functions.
* Implement TypeScript interfaces and types for prop definitions and state management.
* Ensure code quality and consistency with ESLint and Prettier integrations.
Project Technologies
UI and Styling
* @emotion/react & @emotion/styled: For CSS-in-JS styling, enabling dynamic and theme-based styles.
* @ariakit/react: Provides accessible UI primitives for building interactive components.
* lucide-react: A library of SVG icons for React applications.
Form Handling and Validation
* react-hook-form: Efficient form management with minimal re-renders.
* yup: Schema validation for form inputs.
* @hookform/resolvers: Integrates Yup with react-hook-form for seamless validation.
Internationalization (i18n)
* react-i18next, i18next, i18next-browser-languagedetector, i18next-http-backend: Comprehensive tools for managing translations, language detection, and loading translation files.
Authentication and Authorization
* next-auth: Handles authentication with support for various providers.
* @next-auth/sequelize-adapter: Adapter to integrate next-auth with Sequelize for database management.
* js-cookie: Manages cookies for maintaining user sessions.
State Management and Utilities
* lodash.debounce: Optimizes performance by debouncing rapid function calls.
* redis: In-memory data structure store for caching and session management.
* sequelize & sequelize-typescript: ORM for interacting with PostgreSQL databases using TypeScript.
Backend Services and Data Handling
* firebase & firebase-admin: Provides backend services like authentication, database, and storage.
* csv-parser: Parses CSV files for data import/export functionalities.
* jose: Handles JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure data transmission.
API Documentation
* swagger-client, swagger-ui-react, next-swagger-doc: Tools for generating and displaying API documentation.
Table and Data Display
* @tanstack/react-table: Flexible and extensible data table component for React.
Other Utilities
* @svgr/webpack: Transforms SVGs into React components for easy integration.
* typescript: Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved developer experience and code quality.
DevDependencies
Testing
* @playwright/test: End-to-end testing framework for web applications.
* @testing-library/react & @testing-library/jest-dom: Utilities for testing React components with a focus on accessibility.
* jest, jest-environment-jsdom, ts-jest: JavaScript testing framework with TypeScript support and JSDOM environment for DOM testing.
Type Definitions
* @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/jest, @types/js-cookie, @types/lodash.debounce, @types/sequelize: Provides TypeScript type definitions for various libraries.
Linting and Formatting
* eslint, eslint-config-next, eslint-config-prettier, eslint-plugin-prettier, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, @typescript-eslint/parser: Ensures code quality and consistency with ESLint and Prettier integrations.
* prettier: Code formatter for maintaining consistent code style.
Environment Management
* dotenv-cli: Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
Build and Run Tools
* tsx: Executes TypeScript files directly without precompiling.
Project Features and Functionalities
* Internationalization (i18n): Supports multiple languages with automatic language detection and dynamic loading of translation files.
* Responsive Design: Utilizes Emotion and Ariakit for building accessible and responsive UI components.
* Authentication: Implements secure user authentication and session management with next-auth and Redis.
* Form Management: Handles complex forms with validation using react-hook-form and Yup.
* Data Handling: Integrates with Firebase for backend services and uses Sequelize ORM for database interactions with PostgreSQL.
* API Documentation: Generates and displays interactive API documentation using Swagger tools.
* Testing: Ensures application reliability with comprehensive testing using Playwright for E2E tests and Jest with React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
* State Management: Optimizes performance with debouncing and uses Redis for caching strategies.
* Developer Experience: Maintains code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.
